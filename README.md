#### About me

My name  is Noor Misk Im computer science graduate from BAU 
interested in **web development**.

### What I learned form toyday lecture:  

1. #### CLI vs GUI
    
    In computing, there are two distinct ways of interacting with a computer system: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI). 
    
    A GUI provides a visual and intuitive way of interacting with a system, while a CLI requires knowledge of specific commands and syntax. GUI is typically more user-friendly, while CLI offers greater functionality and efficiency

2. #### version control system
    
    Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.
    
    example on VCS is git ⇒ Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together

3. #### git commands /GitHub
    
    
    1.  pwd
     command stands for ‘print working directory’ and as the name says,
    it displays the directory in which we are currently
    
    2. mkdir
     stands for ‘make directory’ and it creates a new directory.
    
    3. rmdir
     command deletes any directory we want to delete and you can remember it 
     by its names ‘rmdir’ which stands for ‘remove directory’
    
    4. cd 
    command stands for ‘change directory’
    
    5. ls
     command simply displays the contents of a directory.
    
    6. touch
     command creates a file(not directory) and you can simple add an extension 
    such as .txt after it to make it a Text File.
    
    7. cd ..
      to go back in folder
    
    8. rm -rf 
      to delete a file or folder
    
    9. clear
    to clear terminal history
    
    10. code . 
      to open the folder in  vs code 
    
    11.  ~ 
    the root
    
    Some of git commands :
    
    1. git init
    
             to make a folder under the git system
    
     2. ls -a

            to check if the folder under the git system 
    
    git system has 3 areas :
    
    1. working area
    2. staged area
    3. saved area
    
    its where we modify or work on the code and in the working area no changes are saved.
    
    in the staged area we select the changes you want to include in the saved area
    
    in the saved area is where you save your code
    
    how to pass through working area to staging area? 
    
     git add .  
    
    how to pass through staging area to the saving area? 
    
    git commit -m ‘commit message’
    
    git push 
    
    GitHub ⇒ its a web based platform used for code hosting and storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
    
    1. create dir
    2. create repo in GitHub
    3. link between them (git commands)
    4. start working 
    5. save your work and push it
    
   ##### ACP : add ⇒ commit ⇒ push
